The O.G. NESasm assembler for NES 6502 assembly, version 3.1 (Latest as of March 2016). Includes `Makefile` for OS X / Linux / other Unix-like OSes.

###### Usage

```bash
cd source && make && sudo make install
```

Then run the assembler with `nesasm`.

See [`usage.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camsaul/nesasm/master/usage.txt) for more details.


###### Credits

Original source, by [bunnyboy](http://nintendoage.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Users.Home&User=bunnyboy), is [available here](http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/).
The only modifications I made were inclusion of the `Makefile`, which was adapted from the one included with [MagicKit](http://www.magicengine.com/mkit/), and the text files,
which were found in various places in the aforementioned sites and by lots of research/searching on my part.
